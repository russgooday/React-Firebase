# A Look at useState and useEffect Hooks
### A Vanilla JS Implementation

I wanted to share a video I have been looking into (it's an old one) on React Hooks. Note it is simplified and doesn't cover dispatching and fibres, but it does give a decent idea of how these hooks work.

[Getting closure on React Hooks by Shawn Wang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJP1E-Y-xyo&t=1178s)

I made a point of pausing the video at various points, and trying to solve the coding issues myself. A worth while exercise and it has given me a better appreciation for how useState and useEffect work.

You can see my final Vanilla JS implementation of useState and useEffect in the useHooks.js script.
